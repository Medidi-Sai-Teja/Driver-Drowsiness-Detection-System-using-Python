🚗 Driver Drowsiness Detection System
📌 Project Overview

A computer vision-based safety application that monitors drivers’ eye movements to detect signs of drowsiness. If drowsiness is detected, an alarm is triggered to alert the driver and prevent accidents.

🚀 Features

✅ Real-time Monitoring using a camera feed.

✅ Eye Detection & Tracking with face landmarks.

✅ Drowsiness Alert – Alarm sound when fatigue is detected.

✅ Lightweight & Portable – Can run on laptops or embedded systems.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy

Tools: Git, GitHub

🧩 Challenges & Solutions

Accuracy in Different Lighting: Optimized OpenCV preprocessing for better detection.
